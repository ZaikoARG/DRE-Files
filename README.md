# DRE-Files
Deleted, Replaced and Renamed Files Checker for Windows

This is a code that I made a while ago in an old project.
It has some errors but I'm still uploading it since parts of the code can help people interested in Forensic Security in Python.

I didn't take the time to rebuild it since I'm busy with more important projects, I hope it can help you :)
