# DRE-Files
Deleted, Replaced and Renamed Files Checker for Windows

This is a code that I made a while ago in an old project.
It has some errors but I'm still uploading it since parts of the code can help people interested in Forensic Security in Python.

I didn't take the time to rebuild it since I'm busy with more important projects, I hope it can help you :)

What this program does, in a nutshell, is parse the USN Journal on the disk to determine which files were recently Deleted, Renamed, or Replaced.
It is important to know that this parse is limited to certain types of files only.
